Algorithm for op(x, y, FUN, filter = FALSE, part = FALSE) --------------------------------------------------




y is Counts
- if 'x' has a dimension that 'y' does not, raise an error
- if 'y' as a dimension that 'x' does not, collapse the dimension
- use any mappings (or implied mappings) to convert categories on
shared dimensions to version used by 'x'
- if shared dimension has categories in 'y' but not in 'x'
    - if filter is TRUE, remove these cateogies
    - if filter is FALSE, raise an error
- if shared dimension has categories in 'x' but not in 'y'
      - raise error

y is Values
