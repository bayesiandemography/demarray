**demarray** (pronounced "dem-array") contains functions for creating demographic arrays, and for basic actions on demographic arrays such as printing.  It also contains a number of general-purpose internal functions for working with demographic arrays.

**demarray** is still under construction, and not ready for serious use.

## Installation

You can install from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("demarray")
```


TODO

 - [] add_dim_to_metadata - internal function that adds a dimension to the metadata, including guessing dimtype and dimscale using standard rules.
